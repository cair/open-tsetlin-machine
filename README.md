# open-tsetlin-machine
The Open Source Tsetlin Machine framework

## Introduction
Open Tsetlin Machine is machine learning framework that encapsulates the Tsetlin Machine Algorithm and allows for rapid and easy model building. The Algorithm was first introduced by Prof. Ole-Christoffer Granmo in his paper [The Tsetlin Machine - A Game Theoretic Bandit Driven Approach to Optimal Pattern Recognition with Propositional Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01508).
The project was started by [Anders Refsdal Olsen](https://github.com/andersro93) as a project in his Master's Thesis. 

## Installation
In order to use Tsetlin Machine there are a few requirements that needs to be filled. A detailed installation instruction will soon be available in our [docs pages](https://cair.github.io/open-tsetlin-machine/).

## Build status
Coming soon

## Contribution
The project is for now closed for contributions due to it being in a very early state. However, contributions will be accepted in the early 2019. Please then follow our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/cair/open-tsetlin-machine/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
